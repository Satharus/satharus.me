I usually like to tinker with low level programming, reverse engineering, Linux, and hardware and stuff. You can find the link to my GitHub in the footer of this page. 

Here's some of the work I am proud of, in no particular order:

- Check out some of my [Bash Snippets](https://github.com/Satharus/Bash-Snippets)
- Full 128-bit [AES Encryption](https://github.com/Satharus/AES-Encryption) written in x86 assembly without using the AES-NI extension. Alongside is the [NASM template](https://github.com/Satharus/NASM-Template) for writing quick assembly programs
- The not so [chad shell](https://github.com/Satharus/Chell)
- The (forever) WIP GDB interface: [Disass](https://github.com/Satharus/Disass)


Not strictly software, but related:

- [My dot files](https://github.com/Satharus/dotfiles)
- [EOI 2019 Competitive Programming Sessions](https://github.com/Satharus/EOI-Preparation-Sessions) for middle schoolers
- Open Source Community [FCIS Linux Workshop 2019 content](https://github.com/Satharus/OSC19-Linux-Workshop-Sessions)
