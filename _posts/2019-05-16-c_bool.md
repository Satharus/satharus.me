I have been writing quite a bit of C code for the past few months, I never really thought **that** it was that different from C++. Boy, was I wrong. There are many differences, and in some sense, I found C a lot more fun.

<!--more-->

One of the differences that had me really surprised is the lack of a boolean data type. Prior to the 1999 standard of C (C99), the C programming language didn’t have a boolean data type. The reason for that is because they didn’t specifically need it. They just used good ol’ integers and characters, basically anything that can be used with value 0 for false and any other value for true. In the end, everything is stored as bytes in memory. (Check the bonus at the end of the article)

A `_Bool` keyword was added in 1999 to refer to the boolean data type, which looks kinda ugly. So, they also added the [stdbool.h header file](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/basedefs/stdbool.h.html) which just had macros so that you can use the keyword `bool` normally.

If you didn’t include it, you’d have to use `_Bool` for a boolean, `1` for `true`, and `0` for `false`.

This is just a quick fact that you might not have known, and I found it interesting. If you liked it then share it with your friends! If you want to read more then check the bonus part of the article, it’s a little bit more technical and even has some assembly code in it.

Earlier in this post, I said that everything is stored as bytes in memory, that means that the CPU doesn’t care whether you typed `char` or `bool` in your code as they both occupy 1 byte.

If you typed in `int`, however, that would be quite different. Depending on your platform, an integer may occupy 4 or more bytes. It can also occupy 2, but that’s with really old 16-bit platforms.

I did a small test on a 64-Bit Linux machine running on an Intel i5 2400 with GCC 8.3.0.

The 3 files were compiled and their respective binaries were disassembled. That’s what we got, respectively.

char.c and bool.c both compiled to the same machine instructions, here they are simplified:

1. Allocate a byte (For a char/bool)*
2. Move the value 1 into that byte.
3. Return 0.

int.c compiled to slightly different machine instructions.

1. Allocate a double word (4 bytes for an integer)*
2. Move the value 1 into those 4 bytes.
3. Return 0.

*Note that if the file was compiled on a different platform, the size of the integer, and maybe other data types may vary.

Thanks for reading!
