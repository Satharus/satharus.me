# Challenge 1 - EZ

Challenge Difficulty: Easy
Challenge Link: [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19GqHAdmPaY5x6N0hJ0Os9QOETIMxpvdp/view)
We are presented with a Linux 64-bit stripped executable called ez.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![file](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/ez-file.png)

Running the file prints nothing useful. Let‚Äôs take a look at in IDA.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![ida](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/ez-ida-1.png)

The first few instructions look like this. The values being moved into rax, rdx, and the places after them are interesting we can get back to them later. but for now there seems to be a huge string being loaded into rdx. let‚Äôs take a look at it using strings to get it in clean ASCII.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![strings](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/ez-strings.png)

It looks like some obfuscated shell code or something of that sort. Especially that we can see a lot of $ signs, pipes, and the command ‚Äúsed‚Äù.
Let‚Äôs try and echo that from BASH to try and de-obfuscate it and see what it will produce.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![deobf](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/ez-deobf.png)

It seems like it is printing something to /tmp/f, let‚Äôs try and cat it.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![cat](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/ez-cat.png)

Well there we go üòÉ no actual reversing needed.

**Flag: ASCWG{b45h_0bfu5c4710n}**


### Bonus: Getting the Flag from the Binary itself
Remember the bytes being moved into memory at the beginning of the program? That‚Äôs the XORd flag. We can take the bytes to a python shell and do the magic there.

# Challenge 2 - easy-101

Challenge Difficulty: Easy
Challenge Link: [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jthXOPG2sTAKq7xB3Vo9KVQffMG1m4ZZ/view)
This challenge was written by [Eng. Mohammad Khreesha](https://twitter.com/banyrock), not me.

We are presented with a Linux 64-bit executable called easy-101.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![file](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/file-easy101.png)

Running it tells us to ‚ÄúTry harder!!‚Äù, okay then.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![Try Harder](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/try-harder-easy101.png)

After spamming a couple of different arguments, it kept printing ‚Äúdrink water!!‚Äù. the output in ltrace and strace didn‚Äôt seem to differ too. So let‚Äôs open it up in IDA.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![drink water](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/drink-water.png)

On opening the binary in IDA, we can see that all it does is validate that you have some form of input that has 3 dashes ‚Äò-‚Äò and then continues to the same block with the big arrays every time.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![ida graph](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/ida-graph.png)

In that same block, we can find that it starts adding the flag format.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![flag format ida](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/flag-format-ida.png)

We can set a breakpoint at the part when the closing brace is added.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![closing brace](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/closing-brace.png)

After that, we can click on var_21 to see the flag.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![flag](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/flag.png)

We could also reverse engineer the parts between ‚Äújmp loc_A3A‚Äù and the var_21 line to see how it gets the flag from the big arrays and then write code for that using Python or anything else. 

While this was what I originally did, it turned out to be way too much effort for a really easy challenge.

```python
BigArray[0] = "AFLdfgArTkdwelkfkmkasFFEWSWasCFsfsdfewRRWDSCFAWDHg";
BigArray[1] = "sddgrlksjpothjafkgpOEWFKQW0EOG9AWRI90VA8RUGWE9R8BIhDJFOIBSDF";
BigArray[2] = "SDSL;FKOKEIER0T9W85690843GJDKVJASFQLIGUQWO;ECLDskvjar;lgksjg1dflb";
BigArray[3] = "kjhKKHJLKlkjhlksriufer9erudskjhLKHJW3EROIWUEOIUkjkhsdllkejgrgpdffSljk";
BigArray[4] = "sdrdgkj4598fgjkksdffvggvljkt66yhpooijjKJWEROJISDOVIHEERGNoqiqwjedqwkd_jaasfefn";
BigArray[5] = "wewro3k34j4r39vjwewlkrfjwefoiasjALDLADSLFKWJEFWk23eqwqfweoryirut0h9dfbjlkwelkw1kj3e3f";
BigArray[6] = "xdlkjefwi9eru8239r2efjkldsvjlwk4g439berflklkjwff1982eiuqukKJSDFKJWEEF0OSDVJLKSKSLKJEFSJW0";
BigArray[7] = "098765432QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM,W453948573498EWIFUERRGKHJFGBKDJGNBDDGksljgerogijdflkb_ckdfbj";
BigArray[8] = "dflfkgdjflgkjdflgsktjhworepgqajrlvLKLSADDKGJWREOGSJIFDLBKXDFGJBLKEKRTHHJOPSFGBJLSKFDGBJSLsdlfkdf4ldkfgj";
BigArray[9] = "DSLDFKGJWREGPOIWERJBSDFLKJBDFGLBKJklsdjff3948tueg98idduvvoierrguj0eer9gjgodfbbojiereoigsdfkgjdfdfdfdfdfNdb";
BigArray[10] = "dglkjerge9r0gwe9fwfoiuiSKDFJFWER9GDEORIJGDFOIBJRTOIBJDFOBIKJER90GGU3U3EGF09USEDGOISDFJGDOetewrtwertwfwFIJB_DF";
'''
.
.
.
'''
BigArray[25] = "flag dfsd dsf sdf "
flag = ['A', 'S', 'C', 'W', 'G', '{']

for i in range(50):
    flag.append('.')

inputLength=6
indexing = 0;

while inputLength < 0x1f:
    if indexing == 0:
        flag[inputLength] = BigArray[0][8];
    else:
        strlen = len(BigArray[indexing-1])
        print(str(indexing) +  " " + str(strlen))
        flag[inputLength] = BigArray[indexing][strlen];

    inputLength = inputLength + 1
    indexing = indexing + 1

    for a in flag[0:31]:
        print(a, end='')
    print("}")


```

This gets us the same output:

{: style="text-align:center"}
![final flag](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/final-flag.png)


**Flag: ASCWG{Th1S_1S_4N_e4Sy_R3v3Rs1Ng}**

# Challenge 3 - mov

Challenge Difficulty: Medium
Challenge Link: [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GSd90E5aodumNSkpRzMy2pKb5ov4k1SO/view)
We are presented with a Linux 32-bit executable called mov. Running it doesn‚Äôt say anything useful except that it is ‚Äúmoving‚Äù something.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![mov run](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/mov-run.png)

Opening the program in IDA, intuitively shows us that it consists of MOV instructions only. That would be hell to debug. 

{: style="text-align:center"}
![mov ida](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/moviida.png)

{: style="text-align:center"}
![r0-1](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/r01.png)

{: style="text-align:center"}
![r0-2](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/r02.png)

{: style="text-align:center"}
![r0-3](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/r03.png)

If we look around the binary we can see a lot of values in the ASCII range being moved into R0.i

We can also open it in Ghidra‚Äôs decompiler and see something very similar but easier to understand.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![ghidra](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/Ghidra.png)

If we extract all these values in order, we get the following string.

> uanfsf_SConoAmibv}iW_s{uct_o!G

Knowing that out flag format is ASCWG{} and that usually in CTF flags words are separated by _ or -, we can reorder the character to end up with the flag

**Flag: ASCWG{mov_obfuscation_is_fun!}**

# Challenge 4 - Hydra 1: KeyValidate

Challenge Difficulty: Hard
Challenge Link: [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gYRcThLA6UnB83gSHwi_R1Tt7FUcHbmM/view?usp=sharing)
We are presented with a Linux 32-bit stripped executable called KeyValidate. Running it asks for a key.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![file](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/file-kv.png)

Opening it in IDA, we can see that it uses MD5, this could be useful later on.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![md5](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/md5.png)

Checking the main function, we find that it takes they key using getline() after the prompt.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![getline](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/getline-kv.png)

After that it gets into the validation loop.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![loop](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/validateloop.png)

We can check for references to MD5() and we find that it is called inside Sub_11FD. This may be an indicator that MD5 is used for validation. We can run it with input ‚Äú1234‚Äù and set a breakpoint right after the MD5 call to see what is being hashed.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![md5](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/md5-call.png)

We can see that the produced hash in arg_4 is the hash for ‚Äú1‚Äù which is the first character of out input.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![hash of 1](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/hash-of-1.png)

{: style="text-align:center"}
![md5](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/md5-1.png)

After the return from that function we can see that a huge array of bytes is being loaded into a variable.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![MD5Arr](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/MD5Arr.png)

After that, it compares the bytes of our inputs after they have been hashed, byte by byte compared to the required hashes stored in the binaries. If it meets a wrong byte it returns.

The hashes stored in the binary are not the actual hashes, each byte has been XORd with its index ANDed with 0xFF. We can conclude this by checking the code for the validation.

```c
XORdHashes[i] = Hashes[i] ^ ((i&0xFF))
```

We can take that large array and do the exact process again (the perks of XOR) to get the original hashes and then break them on [hashes.com](https://hashes.com/).

```python
hashes = [0xe3, 0x59, 0xed, 0xa7, 0x8d, 0xf0, 0x86, 0x65, 0xf9, ........]
for a in range(len(hahes)):
    if a%16 == 0:
        print("")
    print(str('{:02x}'.format(hashes[a]^(a&0xFF))), end='')
```

{: style="text-align:center"}
![hashes](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/Hashes.png)

After replacing each corresponding hash with its character, we get the string: the f1@g !s encrypt3d w!tH a l0g!c g@t3.

Plugging this into KeyValidate, we get the final flag.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![final flag kv](/assets/images/ascwg2020-re/final-flag-kv.png)

**Flag: ASCWG{the f1@g !s encrypt3d w!tH a l0g!c g@t3}**

This challenge was joint with the challenge Hydra 2 which is a Forensics challenge written by [0x01g33k](https://twitter.com/0x01g33k). Here‚Äôs a link to his [writeup on the forensics challenges](https://0x01g33k.wordpress.com/2020/09/13/ascwg-forensics-challenges-final-round-writeups/).

I hope you all enjoyed these challenges as much as I enjoyed writing them. See you in the next CTF!
