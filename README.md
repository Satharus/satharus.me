## The GitHub Page for my Personal Blog

I write about different topics; Anything that I find interesting enough is usually posted on [satharus.me](https://satharus.me).


The blog is hosted using GitHub pages and customised using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [TeXt theme](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/).

Since the blog is static, I couldn’t find a proper way to add a comment system in order to get feedback from my readers without resorting to solutions which affect my readers’ privacy. So I am encouraging anyone who visits it to not hesitate if they have any comments or feedback! Email or DM me your suggestions, feedback, and comments anytime!


Don't forget to share the blog with your mates if you liked it!
